# PROGRESS — Chronological Journal

> **Purpose**: Continuous append-only log of work. Updated as work happens,
> not at the end of sessions. Last 3 entries are read by Claude Code at
> session start (see `CLAUDE.md` §0).
>
> **Format**: each entry is timestamped (UTC, ISO 8601), tagged with task ID,
> and describes one observable action. Never edit past entries; correct via
> a new entry that supersedes.

## 2026-05-12

### [2026-05-12T00:00:00Z] [bootstrap] Project scaffolding generated

Initial scaffolding generated externally (via planning conversation) and
delivered as a tarball. Repository contents:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
- `docs/` with 11 documentation files (STATE, SPEC, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP,
  PLAN, PROGRESS, DECISIONS, SKILLS, AI_WORKFLOW, PROTOCOL, GLOSSARY).
- Empty directories: `crates/`, `data/`, `build-aux/`, `po/` (each preserved
  with a `.gitkeep` placeholder).
- `INIT_PROMPT.txt` for the first Claude Code session.

No code yet. No git history yet. T-001 will create the first commit.

### [2026-05-12T10:30:00Z] [T-001] Started

Plan: validate the scaffolding against `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2, record the
validation outcome as an ADR, set `PLAN.md`/`STATE.md` to reflect T-001,
then `git init` on `main` and make the single bootstrap commit
`chore: initial scaffolding (T-001)`. The four intentional `.gitkeep` files
in `crates/`, `data/`, `build-aux/`, `po/` stay (user-confirmed
microconvention — they preserve §2's directory skeleton and are removed
naturally when later tasks fill those dirs).

### [2026-05-12T10:30:00Z] [T-001] Structure validated against ARCHITECTURE §2

Compared the working tree against `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2. Present: `CLAUDE.md`,
`README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/` (11 files), and the four `.gitkeep`'d
directories. Justifiably absent (each mapped to a later PLAN task in
[[ADR-0010]]): `Cargo.toml`, `meson.build`, `LICENSE`, all Rust source under
`crates/`, all assets under `data/`, gettext files in `po/`, and the Flatpak
manifest in `build-aux/`. Acceptance criterion #3 satisfied.

### [2026-05-12T10:30:00Z] [T-001] DONE — repository initialized

`git init -b main` ran in the project root. `git add` staged the entire
scaffolding (respecting `.gitignore`). `git commit` produced the single
bootstrap commit `chore: initial scaffolding (T-001)`. `git status` is
clean afterwards. All T-001 acceptance criteria met. Next: propose T-002
(namespace + license decisions) to the user.
